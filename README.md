# 05 Work Day Scheduler

This week I was tasked with using HTML, Javascript, Jquery, Bootstrap to create a work day scheduler/

# Project Description
I added multiple section elements that contain Divs that allow you to enter text to plan your day out according to the hour and is also color coded. After text is entered you click save and it should save, although I am having issues with it staying after refreshing the screen. Any tips or advice would be appreciated!
